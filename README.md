### The problem onchain\_times solves

In today's digital world, news is often overwhelming, unverified, and prone to misinformation. People struggle to find credible sources, and the traditional news consumption experience feels outdated and passive.

### How onchain\_times Helps

* **Instant, AI-Summarized News** – Bite-sized, AI-verified news summaries in seconds.
* **Misinformation Control** – AI agents analyze credibility, assigning confidence scores to filter unreliable sources.
* **Interactive & Engaging** – A Tinder/Reels-style swipe interface makes news effortless and fun.
* **Ownership & Rewards** – Mint news as NFTs, contribute stories, and earn tokens for engagement.
* **Decentralized & Transparent** – Powered by Web3 for censorship-resistant, community-driven verification.

### User Interaction and Data Flow

1. **News Fetching** – AI agents fetch news from trusted sources and decentralized oracles.
2. **Processing & Summarization** – NLP + sentiment analysis create concise summaries, with credibility scoring.
3. **User Interaction** – Swipe through news like Reels/Tinder; expand for details or sources.
4. **Verification** – Users rate/report, AI fact-checks, and validates before publishing.
5. **Minting & Ownership** – Verified news can be minted as NFTs, stored on-chain.
6. **Rewards System** – Tokens for reading, contributing, and verifying.
7. **User-Generated Content** – Community-submitted news, validated by AI + users, becomes part of the feed.

### Project Architecture & Development Process

**onchain\_times** is a decentralized AI-powered news platform that makes news consumption interactive, credible, and rewarding. It combines NLP, blockchain, and a swipe-based UI to deliver bite-sized, verified news summaries while enabling ownership and incentives via Web3.

#### Core Functionality

1. **AI-Powered News Processing**

   * Aggregates from trusted + decentralized sources
   * AI summarization with NLP
   * Sentiment & credibility scoring

2. **Interactive User Experience**

   * Swipe-based UI (Tinder/Reels style)
   * Expandable deep dives

3. **Blockchain & Decentralization**

   * NFT minting of news
   * Smart contracts for publishing, verifying, rewards
   * Decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave)

4. **AI Fact-Checking & User Contributions**

   * AI fact-checks submissions
   * Community validations

5. **Reward System & Tokenomics**

   * Tokens for readers, verifiers, and contributors
   * Incentives for fact-checkers & creators

### Development Status

* AI agents for summarization, fact-checking, and credibility scoring are **already implemented and set up**, but **not yet deployed**.
* They will be deployed on **OG compute in the next waves**, where we’ll also **strengthen infra and optimize scaling**.
* Future waves include advanced infra, DAO governance, mobile apps, and stronger NLP for bias detection.

### Product Integrations

* **OPENAI**
* **PRIVY**
* **PRISMA DB**
* **NEWSAPI**
* **RENDER**

### Key Differentiators

* **AI-Powered Verification** – Real-time fact-checking & summaries.
* **Interactive Swipe UI** – Fun, simple news experience.
* **News NFTs & Rewards** – Own digital journalism + earn tokens.
* **Built on Base** – Low gas, fast, decentralized.

### Trade-offs & Shortcuts

* Prioritized MVP speed over feature-completeness.
* AI agents run on centralized infra for now; will move to decentralized compute.
* Simplified tokenomics for early stage.
* Web-first approach, mobile later.
* Limited on-chain storage for efficiency.

### Future Optimizations (Next Waves)

* Deploy AI agents on **OG compute**
* Strengthen infra for scale
* Community-driven DAO governance
* Mobile app launch
* Advanced NLP for bias detection
* Fully decentralized AI + fact-checking
